# 💬 Django Real-Time Chat Engine
A professional, high-performance real-time communication engine built using **Django Channels**, **WebSockets**, and **Django ORM**. This project implements an asynchronous backend architecture to handle both public room broadcasting and secure one-to-one private messaging.

---

## 🚀 Recent Update: Milestone 6 (One-to-One Private Messaging)
The engine has evolved from a public broadcaster to a sophisticated private communication tool:

- [x] **Dynamic Private Room Logic:** Implemented a unique Room-ID generation algorithm using sorted User IDs (e.g., `private_1_2`) to ensure consistent private channels.
- [x] **Isolated Database Models:** Created `PrivateChatRoom` and `PrivateMessage` models to ensure private data is stored separately from public room logs.
- [x] **Hybrid WebSocket Consumer:** Upgraded `ChatConsumer` to intelligently detect and route messages based on room types (Public vs. Private).
- [x] **User Directory Dashboard:** A new UI section in `index.html` that allows users to see all registered members and initiate private chats instantly.
- [x] **Persistence for DMs:** Fully integrated history fetching for private chats, ensuring messages and images remain accessible after reload.

---

## 🛠️ Core Features Implementation (Milestone 1 - 5)

- [x] **ASGI Configuration:** Powered by `Daphne` using `ProtocolTypeRouter` for seamless HTTP/WebSocket handling.
- [x] **Dockerized Redis Broker:** Uses `Redis` as the channel layer to manage real-time message brokering.
- [x] **Multimedia Support:** Instant image sharing using Base64 encoding and unique UUID filename generation.
- [x] **Advanced UX Components:**
    - **Typing Indicators:** Real-time "User is typing..." feedback.
    - **Online Presence:** Live tracking of active users in rooms.
    - **Read Receipts:** Double-tick (✓✓) system indicating message status.
    - **Auto-Hyperlinks:** Automatic URL detection and clickable link conversion.
- [x] **Security:** Full Django Auth integration with restricted access via `@login_required`.

## 📂 Technical Workflow & Architecture



1. **Handshake:** Client initiates WebSocket connection to `/ws/chat/<room_name>/`.
2. **Routing:** `routing.py` maps the connection to `ChatConsumer`.
3. **Database Sync:** Uses `@database_sync_to_async` to perform thread-safe ORM operations within the async consumer.
4. **Broadcast Logic:** Messages are received by the consumer, saved to the database, and then broadcasted to the specific Channel Layer group.
5. **Private Logic:** For private chats, the consumer verifies the `private_` prefix and interacts with `PrivateMessage` models instead of the default `Message` model.

---

## 📂 Project Structure (Core Files)

- `asgi.py`: Entry point for ASGI servers.
- `consumers.py`: Handles connection logic and real-time data routing.
- `routing.py`: Maps WebSocket URLs to Consumers.
- `models.py`: Defines `Message`, `PrivateChatRoom`, and `PrivateMessage` schemas.
- `views.py`: Manages page rendering and initial chat history retrieval.
